# ClickOutside

The `ClickOutside` directive calls a function when something outside of the target element is clicked on. This is used internally by components like `Menu` and `Dalog`.

## Usage

The `ClickOutside` action allows you to provide a handler to be invoked when the user clicks outside of the target element. <Components.Example file="ClickOutside/usage" />
