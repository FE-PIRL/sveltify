# Progress Linear

The `ProgressLinear` component is used to convey data visually to users. They can also represent an indeterminate amount, such as loading or processing.

## Usage

In its simplest form, `ProgressLinear` displays a horizontal progress bar. Use the **value** prop to control the progress. <Components.Example file="ProgressLinear/usage" />

## API

- [ProgressLinear](/api/ProgressLinear/)

## Examples

### Indeterminate

Using the **indeterminate** prop, `ProgressLinear` continuously animates. <Components.Example file="ProgressLinear/indeterminate" />

### Reversed

Displays reversed progress <Components.Example file="ProgressLinear/reversed" />

### Stream

The stream property works with `buffer` to convey to the user that there is some action taking place. You can use any combination of `buffer` and `value` to achieve your design. <Components.Example file="ProgressLinear/stream" />

### Striped

This applies a striped background over the value portion of the `ProgressLinear`. <Components.Example file="ProgressLinear/striped" />

### Slots

You can display anything inside the progress bar. <Components.Example file="ProgressLinear/slots" />
